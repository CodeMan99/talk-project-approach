# Project Start

My resume project start with **Pug** templates v1. Building with the `pug` cli.

<!-- I did learn CSS `display: flex` which I leverage for the column output -->

---

# Upgrades

Practice keeping up-to-date and adapting as necessary over time.

<!--
For example, when pug v3 came out, the CLI was no where to be found.

I replaced it with a simple node.js script + the npm `reload` library.
-->
